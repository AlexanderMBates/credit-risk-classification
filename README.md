## Overview of the Analysis

In this exercise we evaluated a model based on loan risk and where tasked with creating a logistic regression model to help evaluate the data given that can identify the creditworthiness of borrowers.
this dataset analyis was focused on:

- the size of the loan

- interest rate of the loan

- the borrower's income

- the debt-to-income ratio

- the number of accounts the borrower held

- marks against the borrower

- the total debt

a test and training set were made to help train the model, and then set to fit and predicted upon further using the sklearn imports for logistic regression and splitting the training/test data.


## Results

Precision: 93% 
Accuracy: 94%
Recall: 95% 

## Summary

the logistic regression model proved to be quite accurate at its prediction but the data given and the predictions shown suggest at least a few false positives would occur without adequate supervision of the model as well as further training would be needed for actual use.
